# AirBnB Clone README

## Project Description
The AirBnB Clone project is a simplified version of the popular AirBnB website, aimed at providing a platform for users to manage and book accommodations. It implements basic functionalities of AirBnB, allowing users to create, manage, and book listings for accommodations.

## Command Interpreter Description
The command interpreter is a Python-based application that serves as the backbone of the AirBnB Clone project. It provides a CLI interface for users to interact with the system, perform various operations, and manage accommodations.

### How to Start
To start the command interpreter, follow these steps:
1. Clone the AirBnB Clone repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run the command `python3 console.py` to start the command interpreter.

### How to Use
Once the command interpreter is running, you can enter commands directly into the terminal. The interpreter will parse the input and execute the corresponding actions. Here are some guidelines for using the command interpreter:

- Enter commands in the specified format (e.g., command_name [arguments]).
- Use the `help` command to display a list of available commands and their descriptions.
- Follow the prompts and input requirements for specific commands.
- Take note of any error messages or feedback provided by the interpreter.
